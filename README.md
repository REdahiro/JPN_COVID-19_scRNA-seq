# Single-cell analyses of PBMC from COVID-19 and healthy controls of Japanese

## Overview
This repository provides code used for single-cell transcriptome and T/B cell receptor analyses of > 895,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 73 COVID-19 patients and 75 healthy controls of Japanese with host genetics data.

## Data availability
Raw sequencing data of scRNA-seq are available at the Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA) with accession codes [JGAS000593](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/jga-study/JGAS000593)/[JGAD000722](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/jga-dataset/JGAD000722). A part of the raw scRNA-seq data (nCOVID-19 = 30, nControl = 31) has already been deposited and is available under controlled access at JGA with accession codes [JGAS000543](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/jga-study/JGAS000543)/[JGAD000662](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/jga-dataset/JGAD000662). All the raw sequencing data of scRNA-seq can also be accessed through application at the NBDC with the accession code [hum0197](https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/hum0197-latest). Genotype data of the subjects are available at European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) with the accession code [EGAS00001006950](https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001006950).
