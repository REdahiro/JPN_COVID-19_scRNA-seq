# Single-cell analysis of PBMC from COVID-19 and healthy controls of Japanese

## Overview
This repository provides code used for single-cell transcriptome and T/B cell receptor analyses of > 895,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 73 COVID-19 patients and 75 healthy controls of Japanese with host genetics data.

## Data availability
Raw sequencing data of scRNA-seq are available under controlled access at the Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA) with accession codes JGASxxxx/JGADxxxx (https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/jga-study/JGASxxxx), which can be accessed through application at the NBDC with the accession code hum0197 (https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/hum0197-latest). Part of the scRNA-seq data (n = 61) is deposited at the JGA with accession codes [JGAS000543](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/jga-study/JGAS000543) and [JGAD000662](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/jga-dataset/JGAD000662).
Genotype data of the subjects are available under controlled access at European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) with the accession code EGASxxxx (https://).
